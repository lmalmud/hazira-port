quay cranes 19 h uptime/day with 2x1.2 h downtime; 
RTGs (yard) 15h uptime with 2Ã—1 h events;
model failure interarrival via Weibull(k = 1.7).

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weibull_distribution
Weibull distribution often represents time to failure or 
time between events. k > 1 means that the failure rate
increases with time.

We would like the expected value of something drawn from this distribution to be 12,
so that events occur every 12 hours on average. We can solve for what we need to scale
by: E(T) = \lambda \gamma(1 + \frac{1}{1.7})
so \lambda = \frac{12}{\gamma(1 + \frac{1}{1.7})}

This is a test to see if the total amount of repair time is as expected.
This is a quay crane, so it should fail approximately twice a day for 1.2 hours each time.
So, we expect the accumulated time of failure to be 2.4 hours a day.
